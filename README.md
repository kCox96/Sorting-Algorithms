This project implements the insertion sort, quicksort and bingo sort algorithms. 

The aim of this assignment was to:
- provide me with experience of implementing algorithms documented using psuedo code. 
- strengthen my understanding of sorting algorithms. 
- provide me with practical experience of implementing, testing and evaluating different sorting algorithms.
